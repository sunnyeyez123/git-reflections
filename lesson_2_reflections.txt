What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a .git file is creted
so git can make a repositiory in the directory
so you can start tracking the files in that directory


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


staging area holds the files that will be in your next commit
that commit will then go into the repository
the working directory can contain new and uncommited changes
it can also contain files you arent ready to commit
the value is having a place to hold pending changes
