When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

you may not have space for all the code for all the branches on your pc

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

you might have changes that are different or conflict with the live changes
your changes might not be ready to be made public


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

a fork is a copy of someones repo on github to my github
use when you want to edit or contribute to someones project
a clone brings code from a remote (maybe github) to my laptop
use when you want to get code locally to make changes
a branch makes a copy of my code on laptop in the same repo
use when making a new project feature or bug fix

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

you can know where you stand with your new changes vs the online code even it you're not ready to push
you can continue to work offline after grabbing the last remote state
then you can work on resolving any merge conflicts offline to make merging your changes to the remote easier


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

i would have to use dropbox or email files
using git is easier because we can track, edit and commit on changes 
it would be hard to keep all the code and changes in sync

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

whenever you are doing something you arent 100% sure you're ready to share
